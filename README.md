git-ribbon
==========

This Perl script helps you review the latest changes to a git repository.

How to use it
-------------

**First** mark your place with

    ⚡ git ribbon --save

This will place a tag named __ribbon at origin/master.  Basically we are
bookmarking our current spot with a 'ribbon'.

**Next**, pull down the latest changes made by your fellow conspirators from the
remote repository.  To review those changes do the following:

    ⚡ git ribbon
    Eric Johnson 6 weeks ago ecf43db
    Css tweaks.
    root/html/calculator/realCost.tt

    press 's' to skip 

    Eric Johnson 6 weeks ago 9595fa0
    fix css margin class.
    root/css/networth.css
    root/css/style.less
    root/css/style.less.old
    root/html/calculator/realCost.tt
    root/html/fi.tt

    press 's' to skip

    Added daysPerYear.
    lib/Networth/Controller/Calculator.pm
    lib/Networth/Out/RealCost.pm
    root/html/calculator/realCost.tt

    press 's' to skip 

The script will pause when it prints "press 's' to skip".  This gives you the
opportunity to view the diff with 'git difftool' or skip that and move on to
the next revision.  

**Finally**, after you have reviewed all the changes, mark your place again with:

    git ribbon --save


Pro tips
--------

In your .gitconfig add this:

    [diff]
        tool = vimdiff
    
For more, read 'git help difftool' and 'git help config'.

The default colors for vimdiff were created by insane clowns.  So try this
instead:

    ⚡ mkdir -p ~/.vim/colors/
    ⚡ wget https://github.com/kablamo/dotfiles/blob/master/links/.vim/colors/iijo.vim -O ~/tmp/iijo.vim
    ⚡ echo "colorscheme iijo" >> ~/.vimrc

To quickly exit vimdiff type 'ZZ'.  To open folds type 'zo'.  To switch windows
type 'ctl-w l' and 'ctl-w h'.  For more help with vim type ':help'.
